      "title": "OPINION: Leadership imperatives for 2026",
      "description": "2025 was a year of leadership expose\u0301. A year of revelations. A testing year. A year of stress. A year of burnout.An overwhelming year. It has been quite a year. In any testing time, as they say, the mettle of leadership is exposed.Unfortunately, in many cases leaders all across the world were found wanting. Some glossy names were tarnished.Some established names were toppled. Corporate corridors witnessed scams and stealth stories. Those who seemed steady were also struggling with the pressures of an economy far from vibrant and boardrooms that were relentless. This led to low morale, low productivity and results that were either made up or lackluster.In my leadership coaching interactions many leaders complained about \u201cunrealistic expectation\u201d, \u201cunconducive conditions\u201d and \u201cunending struggles\u201d to motivate employees.Numbers tell the story. The Leadership Development statistics published in Exec magazine on 18th December 2025 highlight the growing gap. 77 percent of organizations lack sufficient leadership dept. This leadership deficit is across all levels, ranging from frontline managers to executives. This deficit is influencing business agility and succession planning in various sectors.Without capable senior leaders in place, organisations struggle to adapt and stay competitive. Trust in managers dropped from 46 percent to 29 percent in just two years (2022-2024). 71 percent of Millennials are warning that they will leave within 3 years if leadership development is lacking. 53 percent of Gen Z are unhappy with their leaders. These are staggering numbers. These are wakeup calls. These underline the leadership fault lines. These highlight the disconnect between what needs to be done and what was done in 2025. Those who are led are unhappy with the way they are led and those who are leading are also feeling the heat. 71 percent of leaders have experienced significantly higher stress levels since stepping into leadership, and 63 percent report suffering from burnout.If we keep on going at this rate 2026 may see more organizational disasters. Time to learn from 2025 and rethink leadership as we enter 2026.Based on my experience of working with the top leaders, organizations and leaders need to work on 4 leadership imperatives:Leadership I mperative#1-Reset your mind\u2019s eye-\u201cThe eyes are useless when the mind is blind\u201d. 2025 Leadership mind was set to see the obvious. Economies crunching, industries squeezing and companies retrenching.Could these realities be ignored. Absolutely not. These realities are facts that need to be taken into account. Could the strategies to cope with these realities have been different\u201d?Absolutely yes. But for that, the mindset had to be different. As we go in 2026 the leader\u2019s mind needs to see the gaps as opportunities. When the mind is set to see numbers dropping, the logical solution is to fix the numbers. That means cutting costs, layoffs, shutdowns, etc.While these are all strategies that yield immediate improvement in the financial health of the company, they may not help in real growth. The leader has to say, \u201cFine if these products or markets are not doing well, yes we may do product pruning, but what else can we do that will spur growth?\u201d Get your teams together. Ask them the simple question, if we want to grow when others are reducing, what do you think will work? As the pharmaceutical industry saw many drugs being ousted from the market, one pharmaceutical firm saw blockbuster results. They got the team to spell out the gaps. They focused on the obesity and diabetes awareness on social media.Revenues rose sharply driven by high demand for its new diabetes and obesity drugs, making it the world\u2019s most valuable healthcare company.Leadership Imperative#2-Re-align with the purpose- \u201cWhen you align with your purpose the whole universe aligns with you.\u201d A Gen Z working for a top company recently remarked to me \u201cpurpose, what purpose? The only purpose we know is that the organizations will skin us to death for every penny that they can make additionally.\u201d If there is one aspect where most leaders default is to first of all connect themselves to the purpose of the organization and then align others to it. Purpose or mission is just a statement made for websites.Nobody remembers it, leave aside use it to motivate and create alignment. In the DDI Leadership Study of 2025, frontline leaders experienced a 20 percent decline in their sense of purpose compared to 2020.Leaders underestimate the power of a higher purpose to keep people going. If you tell people to achieve a 25 percent higher target, they feel stressed and demotivated. If you tell people, let us ensure that 25 percent more people\u2019s lives can be saved by the new cardio devise, they actually may feel good about contributing to a higher cause. 2026 should be a leadership purpose disseminator year. DDI study says that workers are 17X more likely to feel energized by their work if they feel that they are working for a higher purpose.Leadership imperative#3-Reconnect to the human domain-Yes it is AI. Yes it is technology. But in pursuit of artificial intelligence, do not forget human intelligence. 2025 was marked by one of the most disengaged workforces ever. Employee disengagement reached crisis levels.According to a Gallup international study, engagement has fallen to its lowest level in a decade, with only 24 percent- 31 percent of employees feeling various digress of engagement at work. The leaders are too busy, too preoccupied and too distracted to give quality time to their people.Almost 70 percent employees feel disenchanted with work. That means that the output per employee will be less than half of their potential. With AI looming large, inflation rising, the employee of today feels abandoned by leaders who are busy pushing for more numbers to notice the rise of quiet quitting.People are there but not really there. Even for the sake of getting more numbers leaders need to change, redesign, and re-engage with employees. Start listening rather than speaking. Start asking rather than telling.Start consulting rather than pushing. At the end leaders need to reach out, find out, feel out what is happening to those who are the main architects of executing the strategy. The further they go away from their people the further they will go away from their targets.Leadership imperative#4-Re-energize commitment- Leaders make great strategy. 80 percent strategies made get lost in execution. Execution is done by teams all the way down. With low morale commitment is a rarity.Leaders need to create new energy in teams. There are three major elements that leaders must focus on. Communicate a compelling purpose. Develop a culture of empowerment and accountability. Recognize, reward and reinforce the behaviours that display commitment.All these imperatives have to be modeled by leaders. That builds credibility. That brings buy-in. That then creates a cadence of engagement and commitment. As John Wooden said, \u201cThe most powerful tool you have is your own example.\u201dCopyright Business Recorder, 2025",

      "title": "EDITORIAL: upcoming spectrum auction",
      "description": "EDITORIAL: Finally, the government is closing in on a much-needed spectrum auction, which is of utmost importance for improving internet speed and reliability in the country. It is a welcome move.Pakistan is a spectrum-starved country, while data usage is rampant. It is like running a six-lane traffic load on a two-lane road. The result is obvious congestion, which is adversely impacting everyone.The question is why Pakistan is spectrum starved. One of the prime reasons is that the government has historically viewed spectrum sales as a one-time source of fiscal revenue, while considerations around network improvement and technological advancement remained secondary. This is why there has been no successful auction over the last five years, and with every passing day, service delivery continues to worsen.It appears that the realization is finally gaining ground that the broader economic benefits of spectrum allocation are greater than immediate fiscal gains.However, much will depend on pricing and payment conditions.The government is considering auctioning 600 MHz of spectrum, which is more than double the existing capacity.According to industry experts, the government will be fortunate if even half of the spectrum on offer is successfully auctioned. The key questions are the price set by the government, the currency of payment, and the payment schedule.The spectrum on offer spans different frequencies, ranging from 700 MHz to 3,500 MHz. While spectrum bands are technology-neutral, existing literature suggests that bands below 2,000 MHz are better suited for 3G/4G, while higher bands are more conducive for 5G.Ultimately, it will be the buyers\u2019 discretion to decide how they deploy the spectrum.The priority should be to improve speed for a large segment of the population and, for that, strengthening existing 3G/4G networks is critical.The focus must be on immediate improvements. According to the CEO of a leading Telco, better spectrum availability can increase speeds by 10\u201320 times, which is reassuring.At the same time, the government appears keen on headlines around rolling out 5G, even though its usage is currently limited and only a small number of expensive handsets are 5G-enabled. That said, 5G is the network of the future, and Pakistan should build the infrastructure needed to move up the value chain in areas such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing.It is good to dream in view of the fact that dreams can sometime offer unique perspectives or solutions to future problems in a self-reflective way, but securing today\u2019s potential is more important.The government has been mulling over these auctions for the past eighteen months. One major hurdle was the pending approval of Ufone\u2019s acquisition of Telenor, which has now been resolved. There are three players in the market, the structure is in place, and the time to move forward has arrived.The government must design the auction in a way that maximizes proceeds without imposing excessive upfront costs on operators. It must also ensure that operators invest in technology upgrades and deliver better speeds and network quality for everyone.The mistakes of the last auction when no spectrum could be sold should not be repeated. At the same time, the deal must be structured in a way so that consumers can benefit from it.Operators should be required to invest in technology, as seen in India, while the government can recover value through higher tax revenues and exports resulting from increased economic activity.Copyright Business Recorder, 2025",
